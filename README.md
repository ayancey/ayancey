## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm having fun contributing and learning about LLMs and ASR models.

Here's some silly stuff I've done recently:

* [ZeusIRL](https://github.com/ayancey/ZeusIRL)
  - Shocks you with a TENS unit when you die in Counter-Strike
  - Might work in CS2, but I wrote it in the CS:GO era
* [JeopardyInteractive](https://github.com/ayancey/JeopardyInteractive)
  - Aligns J! Archive answers with episode timecode using [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX)
  - Speech-to-Text to verify you answered correctly
  - Just a proof of concept, barely works
 
Pinned repos are projects I've contributed to or just find interesting.

Thanks for reading!
